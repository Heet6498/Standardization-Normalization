# Standardization-and-Normalization

Complete guide for every data standardization and transformation technique with implementation.

### Data Source

- This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
- The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

### Standardization
- StandardScaler
- Min Max Scaling
- MaxAbsScaler
- Unit Vector Scaler/Normalizer
- RobustScaler

### Normalization
- Logarithmic Transformation
- Reciprocal Transformation
- Square root transformation
- Exponential transformation
- Boxcox transformation

### Methods which standardization and transformation at the same time
- Quantile Transformer
- Power Transformer
